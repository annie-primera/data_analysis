Education programs for children have different aims and objectives. Some of them are applied in the schools and the other outside the school as an informal learning sessions. There are also outdoor programs, which focus on developing the children's life skills as well as improving their academic learning. Although there are a variety of education programs for children, they are few programs which focus on using the skills learned after the end of the program. This process called 'transfer of learning', which defined by Macaulay& Cree as 'prior learning affecting new learning or performance'. Applying the experimental learning techniques in a program's sessions can encourage the transfer of learning process.
